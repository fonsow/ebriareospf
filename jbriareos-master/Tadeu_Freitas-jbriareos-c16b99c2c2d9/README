Please install Docker to be able to run Briareos
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

How to build Briareos's worker's docker image:
    - From inside the project folder (Briareos_Java, where this README is located):
        ./src/build-zworker-docker-image.sh

    - There is no need to run this command any more than once, as a ZCluster executes it when it is initialized

nfqueue bindings:
    - Before executing any component of the system, execute the "make_lib" script, which is inside the nfQueueBind folder
        - Users must have a JDK package installed, preferably opendjk-11-jdk

Before starting a JMS instance:
    - Generate a ZMQ certificate via the GenerateZMQCertificate .jar.
        $ java -jar GenerateZMQCertificate.jar server

Before starting a JHC or ZCluster instance:
    - Place the JMS's public certificate inside the .servercert folder, at the project's root.
        - This process must be repeated every time the JMS generates a new certificate for itself.

    - Generate a ZMQ certificate via the GenerateZMQCertificate .jar, and copy it to the JMS.
        $ java -jar GenerateZMQCertificate.jar [client/cluster]
    
        - On the JMS, the file must be renamed to whatever value is present in that certificate's ID field and
        have a .pubkey extension

            Example:
            A certificate with the ID field value f5715a68-59d8-4b69-8ad9-f9139f6b5180,
            must be renamed on the JMS to f5715a68-59d8-4b69-8ad9-f9139f6b5180.pubkey
    
    - If a cluster certificate was generated, it will be present on the .clustercert folder
    - If a JHC certificate was generated, it will be present on the .clientcert folder
    
NOTE:
    Each time the artifacts are built, delete their signatures. They are broken.
    Delete the files with .SF extension, which are in the META-INF folder, inside the .jars.
